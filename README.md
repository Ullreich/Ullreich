## Welcome to my Github page
My name is Noel, I am doing a Bachelor's in CompSci at ETH Zurich.

Things I like (in no particular order):
* C/CPP
* Python
* Linux
* Virtualization and emulation (I used to work for ProxMox)
* Machine Learning (mainly computer vision, I did an internship at the Austrian Institute of Technology in this area)
* Markdown and Latex
* (Neo)vim
* building computers and repairing broken electronics
* Esolangs
* Open Source

Besides C, CPP, and Python I also have experience with Julia, Matlab, Maplesoft, Java, Javascript, HTML, and I really want to learn Rust (and perhaps Zig)
